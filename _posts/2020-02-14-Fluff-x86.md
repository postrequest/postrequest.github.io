# Introduction
Fluff is the 5th challenge in the <a href="https://ropemporium.com/">ROP Emproium</a> series.  
This is the approach taken to solve the 32 bit challenge step by step.  
If you would like extra information on Return Oriented Programming (ROP) visit the <a href="https://ropemporium.com/guide.html">ROP Emporium Guide</a>.  

### Challenge description
Sort the useful gadgets from the fluff to construct another write primitive in this challenge.  
You'll have to get creative though, the gadgets aren't straight forward.

# Solution 
The solution will be written in Go using the standard library only.  
Although <a href="https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools#readme">pwntools</a> is a quick and easy way to approach this problem, Go can compile
to a static executable for most target systems.  
Since we already know the exploit path, we can focus on creating a ROP chain to obtain a system shell.  

### Assumptions
You have the following software installed:
- <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>
- <a href="https://www.radare.org/">radare2</a>
- <a href="https://cutter.re/">Cutter</a>
