# Introduction
Fluff is the 5th challenge in the <a href="https://ropemporium.com/">ROP Emproium</a> series.  
This is the approach taken to solve the 32 bit challenge step by step.  
If you would like extra information on Return Oriented Programming (ROP) visit the <a href="https://ropemporium.com/guide.html">ROP Emporium Guide</a>.  

### Challenge description
Sort the useful gadgets from the fluff to construct another write primitive in this challenge.  
You'll have to get creative though, the gadgets aren't straight forward.

# Solution 
The solution will be written in Go using the standard library only.  
Although <a href="https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools#readme">pwntools</a> is a quick and easy way to approach this problem, Go can compile
to a statically linked executable for most target systems.  
Since we already know the exploit path, we can focus on creating a ROP chain to obtain a system shell.  

### Assumptions
You have the following software installed:
- <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>
- <a href="https://www.radare.org/">radare2</a>
- <a href="https://cutter.re/">Cutter</a>

# Technical

#### Inspect the binary
##### Check the properties:
![Binary Info](/assets/img/2020-02-14-Fluff-x86/binary-info.png)
We can see that the NX bit is set. This is the security feature we are defeating.
##### Identify sections:
![Sections](/assets/img/2020-02-14-Fluff-x86/sections.png)
The .data section at 0x0804a028 will be the target to write the string "/bin/sh" for later use.
##### Search for ROP gadgets
In the search field we select "ROP gadgets", search in "All maps" and press "Search".
![Search for ROP](/assets/img/2020-02-14-Fluff-x86/rop-search.png)
Before we can write anything to memory, we need to identify the gadgets that will be best suited for the task.
Searching for all mov instructions, 
```x86asm
mov dword [ecx], edx;  pop ebp;  pop ebx;  xor byte [ecx], bl;  ret;
```
![mov ptr-ecx, edx;  pop ebp;  pop ebx;  xor ptr-ecx, bl;  ret;](/assets/img/2020-02-14-Fluff-x86/mov-edx-to-ecx-ptr.png)
##### Writing strings to .data
From observing the ROP gadgets, 
##### Identify useful ROP gadgets


#### Write the exploit
